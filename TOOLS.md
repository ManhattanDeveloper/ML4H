# Machine Learning for Health
---

## Frameworks & Development Tools

### [Deep Variant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) ### 
**Description:** DeepVariant is an analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data.  
**Tags:** Genomics, Google, GitHub

### [Elevation](https://github.com/microsoft/Elevation)
**Description:** Here, we introduce two interdependent machine learning models for the prediction of off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9. The approach, which we named Elevation, scores individual guideâ€“target pairs, and aggregates such scores into a single, overall summary guide score.  
**Tags:** Genomics, Microsoft, GitHub

### [Healthcare.ai](https://healthcare.ai/) 
**Description:** Healthcare.ai is a community with education and open source technology tools focused on increasing the national adoption of machine learning in healthcare.     
**Tags:** Open Source
